# Hi! I'm Rylee
I also go by Linkeroftime online.

## Who am I?
I am a Computer Information Systems Student at Southern New Hampshire University. I just recently switched majors, but I have always had a keen interest in computers. 

## Why Computer Information Systems?
For the longest time, building computers and computer hardware was something I was very passionate about. I would often make pcpartpicker builds, and constantly keep track of the latest hardware. I had an interest in gaming, but for the most part it was an excuse to keep building computers.

Fast forward to today, and I have a pretty decent setup with a desktop PC, a raspberry pi to run many servers and microservices (Apache, Plex, Minecraft, Pi-Hole, etc.) and my main operating system is Linux (Arch, btw) because I enjoy the control I have over my machine.
I plan on expanding my homelab to support virtualization and other projects that will get me more comfortable as an aspiring SysAdmin.

## Interests

- Chess (Highest Rating 1653 on Chess.com)
- Music and Music Production 
- Computers and computer hardware (big AMD fan)
- Programming (Python, HTML CSS and JavaScript, will be learning Java soon)
- Linux (Arch, Debian, Raspberry Pi OS, soon-to-be Ubuntu Server, Proxmox, and CentOS/Fedora)
- Web Development (Flask, Nodejs with Express, will be learning Go, PHP, and Django in the future).
- I also really enjoy Tea and Coffee. https://queenbeecoffee.com/ is a brand I really enjoy and https://bees-teas.com/ (unrelated to Queen Bee Coffee) is another one of my favorites.

## Wow, that's a lot!
I am a professional hyperfixationalist, if that is a thing. I enjoy learning moreso than anything on the above list, and if something catches my interest, I like learning as much as I can about that one thing! This puts me in a spot to learn a lot of skills very fast, and as such I end up learning a lot of different things.

## So, what are you working on right now?
At the moment, I am trying to get some summer classes in before the next semester. 

- I am currently taking programming in Python and will be taking programming with Java as soon as I am finished with that. 

- I am also studying to pass my A+ certification by the end of the summer, after which I will be looking to pass my network+ as well.

- I am studying to become a System Administrator, as I really enjoy the installation of operating systems, maintanence of devices, and learning about networking and servers. It also helps that I have some skin in the game, since I have a website at rylee-jones.com that I want to convert to being hosted on my own Homelab.

- Before the summer ends I would also like to create a few web development projects and am currently reaching out to some local businesses to see if they need some work done on their websites.

## TL;DR

I am a CIS student studying to become a System Administrator. I have a decent proficiency in Python and Javascript, Linux-based operating systems, and some web development/deployment skills. I really enjoy learning about different technologies and am studying to pass the A+ this summer. My contact info is at rylee-jones.com.
